# Book Recommendation Using C

This application allows users to input books and their reading preferences. It then recommends which books align with their preferences and calculates how many pages they need to read per day to finish the book within their preferred deadline.

## How It's Made:

**Technologies used:** C

First, I wrote the program in pseudocode to establish all the functionalities I wanted to add. Then, I proceeded to Visual Studio and started coding. I declared the necessary variables and worked on receiving user input using different loops and flag variables to validate it.

# Lessons Learned:

I learned different ways to combine iterations and flag variables effectively.
